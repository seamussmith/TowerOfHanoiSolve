# This is my Java Template!

There are many like it, but this one is mine!

## Usage

### Coding

All code goes in the `/src` directory. Follow Java standards accordingly.

### Running and Debugging

In VSCode, use the Run and Debug feature to run or debug. (Click on the bug and play button on the left side, or press the <kbd>F5</kbd> key)

### Building

Use the `build-jar.ps1` script to build a JAR file. The JAR file will be in the `/dist` folder (Might not work that well, considering how rude Java was to me for the past 3 hours)
